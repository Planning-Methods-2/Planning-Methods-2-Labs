# Lab 4 Script: Spatial Data in R
# The University of Texas at San Antonio
# URP-5393: Urban Planning Methods II


#---- Instructions ----

# 1. [20 points] Open the R file "Lab4_Script.R" comment each line of code with its purpose parts 1.1 through 1.3
# 2. [80 points] Open the R file "Lab4_Assignment.R" and answer the questions



#---- Q1. Search for at least one secondary data source that will inform your research project. Do the following steps:

# Q1.1 Create a folder called `my_datasets` in your repository. You can do it manually or using the function `dir.create()`

# Q1.2 Download the data into the `my_datasets` folder. You can do it manually or using the function `download.file()` 

# Q1.3 Load the data into R creating the object `my_data_1` (change the suffix as you add 2,3 or more data sets).



#---- Q2. What is the unit of analysis of your data. Use the functions `str()`, `summary()` and `View()` to describe each of the objects in your dataset. Is the unit of analysis of your data appropriate to answer your research question?


# Q3. What are the variables of interest (outcomes) that you would like to measure in your study? Plot an histogram of the most important variable of interest. Save the plot as `plot_1.pdf` in a new folder `my_results` in your repository. 
# Hint: use the `geom_histogram()` function. 
# Note: if you don't have a variable of interest, select a demographic variable that would be affecting your study and use that instead.

# Q4. BONUS: 20 pts. Think of the best way to show at least two of the variables/concepts your study in plot and save it as `plot_2.pdf`. What can you say about your plot?
